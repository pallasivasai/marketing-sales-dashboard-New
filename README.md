- Did an employee reach the assigned target?
- Which employees are performing above/below target?

- What is the target gap?
- Which brands generated the most sales?
- How many new customers were acquired?
- Can an employee performance report be downloaded as PDF?

## ✨ Key Features

### 📌 Dashboard Overview

Provides high-level business KPIs:

- 💰 Total Sales
- 📦 Total Orders
- 👥 Customers
- 💵 Profit
- 🎯 Total Target
- 📊 Achievement %
- 🎯 Target Gap

Large currency values are displayed without unnecessary truncation.

---

### 🎯 Target Achievement Tracking

The application dynamically calculates:

**Achievement %**

```text
Achievement % = (Actual Sales / Target) × 100
```

**Target Reach**

```text
If Achievement >= 100% → YES
If Achievement < 100%  → NO
```

**Target Status**

```text
Achievement >= 100% → ✅ TARGET REACHED
Achievement < 100%  → ❌ NOT REACHED
```

This means target status is calculated from the actual sales and target data instead of being manually entered.

## 📊 Example Performance Logic

Suppose an employee has:

```text
Monthly Target = ₹20,00,000
Actual Sales   = ₹12,00,000
```

Then:

```text
Achievement = (12,00,000 / 20,00,000) × 100
            = 60%
```

Dashboard result:

```text
Achievement % → 60%
Target Reach  → NO
Status        → ❌ NOT REACHED
```

If actual sales become:

```text
₹22,00,000
```

Then:

```text
Achievement = 110%
Target Reach = YES
Status = ✅ TARGET REACHED
```

The dashboard provides **objective performance metrics** such as:

- Target achievement
- Monthly performance
- Sales contribution
